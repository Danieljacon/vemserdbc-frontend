                    Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some countries and
                    entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding
                    the fort.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix one
                    problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption
                    to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even a celebrity can
                    explain it in simple words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the social
                    currency of their favourite person and watch their
                    investment as is with other crypto currency project.
